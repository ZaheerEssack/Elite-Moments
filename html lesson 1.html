			<p><b>•	Double Membrane Structure:</b> Mitochondria have a double membrane structure, with an outer membrane and an inner membrane.
			This design creates compartments within the mitochondria, allowing for the segregation of different stages of cellular respiration.<p>

<p>•	<b><u><i>Presence of Enzymes:</i></u></b> Mitochondria are specialized for ATP production,
 which is the primary energy currency of the cell. Through the process of oxidative phosphorylation,
 mitochondria generate ATP by transferring electrons through a series of protein complexes in the
 inner mitochondrial membrane.<p>

<p><b>•	Presence of Enzymes:</b> Mitochondria contain a variety of enzymes involved in the different
 stages of cellular respiration, including those necessary for lycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and
 oxidative phosphorylation. These enzymes facilitate the sequential breakdown of glucose and other molecules,
 allowing for the efficient extraction of energy in the form of ATP.</p>
